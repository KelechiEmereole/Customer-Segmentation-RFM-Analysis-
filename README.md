## Introduction

This Power BI project applies RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. The goal is to help businesses identify their most valuable customers, improve customer retention, and make data-driven marketing decisions.

## Project Aim

To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that segments customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM analysis and delivers actionable business insights for data-driven decision-making.

## Project Description

This project simulates a real-world customer segmentation scenario for a retail business using historical transaction data from the Adventure Works dataset spanning 7 years.

### Business Problem:

Companies often struggle to allocate marketing resources effectively due to poor understanding of customer behavior. This analysis helps answer key questions:

* Who are our most valuable customers?

* Which customers are at risk of churning?

* How can we convert new buyers into loyal customers?

Using RFM scores, customers are grouped into segments such as:

* Champions

* Loyal Customers

* At-Risk Customers

* Lost Customers

* Potential Loyalists

  ## Data Acquisition and Preparation

Source: Adventure Works Database

Time Period: 7 years of customer transaction data

Tool Used: Power BI

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

The dataset was cleaned and prepared using Power Query and Power BI to enable accurate RFM segmentation.

### Power Query Steps

Data Type Fixes: Converted key columns (e.g., CustomerKey, GeographyKey, ProductKey) from Whole Number to Text for proper relationship handling.

Column Selection:

Customer: CustomerKey, GeographyKey, FirstName, LastName, BirthDate, MaritalStatus, Gender, Email, PhoneNumber

Geography: Renamed EnglishRegionName to Country

Product: Renamed EnglishProductName to ProductName

Removed irrelevant fields like SalesTerritoryImage.

### Power BI Transformations

Derived Columns:

Age = DATEDIFF(BirthDate, TODAY(), YEAR)

Age Band = Categorized age into ranges (45-54, 55-64, etc.)

### RFM Metric Calculations

Recency: Days since last purchase

Frequency: Count of unique orders

Monetary: Total spending per customer

RFM Table: Created via SUMMARIZE() to consolidate these values

RFM Score: Assigned using percentile-based bins (1–5 scale), then concatenated

### Modeling & Segmentation
Linked RFM Table to:

Segment Table (e.g., Champions, At-Risk, Loyal)

FactInternetSales using CustomerKey

Drillthrough: Enabled deep-dive into each customer segment based on Sales Amount

## Data Analysis and Visualization

This analysis focused on understanding customer behavior through demographics and RFM segmentation using interactive dashboards built in Power BI. The visuals were designed for clarity, insight generation, and stakeholder engagement.

### 1. Customer Demographics Dashboard

This page provides an overview of the customer base by analyzing:

* Total Sales: $29.36M over 7 years.

* Number of Customers: 18.48K unique customers.

* Gender Split: Nearly equal distribution between Male and Female customers.

* Marital Status: Slightly more single customers than married.

* Age Band Analysis: Highest revenue generated by customers aged 55–64.

* Geographic Distribution: Sales concentrated in Europe and parts of North America.

### 2. Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

Using calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values, customers were segmented into groups to evaluate loyalty and profitability.

Key insights:

Top Segments by Count:

* New Customers (3.2K),

* Promising (2.6K),

* Cannot Lose Them (2K).

Top Segments by Revenue:

* Champions ($8.3M),

* At Risk ($7.3M),

* Loyal ($6.2M).

Behavioral Trends:

Champions had recent, frequent, and high-spending patterns.

At Risk customers showed reduced recent activity but contributed high past revenue.

Potential Loyalists showed growing engagement and sales volume.

Visuals included:

Bar charts for segment distribution by count and total sales.

Lollipop charts for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values by segment for behavioral comparison.

### 3. Customer Details Page

This detailed table allows for customer-level drill-down, showing:

Customer profiles (name, age, email, marital status, contact).

Total sales per customer.

Their assigned RFM segment.

The top three customers in the table based on "Total Sales" are:

Nichole Nara: (Customer No: 12301) with Total Sales of $13,295.38.

Kaitlyn Henderson: (Customer No: 12132) with Total Sales of $13,294.27.

Margaret He: (Customer No: 12308) with Total Sales of $13,269.27.

Drill-through filters enabled focused analysis per customer segment.

## Insights and Interpretation

The RFM-based customer segmentation revealed distinct behavioral patterns across customer groups:

* Champions were the most valuable segment, contributing over $8.3M in revenue. They purchased recently, frequently, and spent the most—making them the most loyal and profitable group.

* At Risk customers, while generating significant revenue ($7.3M), showed signs of inactivity, indicating a drop in recent engagement despite high past spending.

* New Customers and Promising segments represented a large share by count but contributed comparatively less to total revenue—signaling early-stage customers with potential for growth.

* The Loyal segment ($6.2M) showed consistent purchasing behavior, reflecting a dependable customer base.

* Age-wise, customers aged 55–64 generated the highest revenue, indicating strong buying power in this demographic.

* The top three individual customers—Nichole Nara, Kaitlyn Henderson, and Margaret He—each contributed over $13K in total sales, with variations in frequency and order value, suggesting diverse shopping patterns even among top spenders.

* Geographically, sales were heavily concentrated in Europe and North America, offering insights into regional performance and possible market focus areas.

## Recommendations

Based on the customer segmentation and sales behavior analysis, the following actions are recommended:

### 1. Nurture Champions and Loyal Customers
Personalized loyalty programs or exclusive deals can help retain and upsell this high-value group.

Encourage referrals through rewards to attract similar customers.

### 2. Re-Engage At Risk Customers
Implement win-back campaigns with targeted offers or reminders.

Use email automation to highlight new products or personalized discounts based on past behavior.

### 3. Grow New and Promising Segments
Educate these customers through welcome emails, product recommendations, and onboarding flows.

Offer first-time purchase incentives to convert them into loyal customers.

### 4. Focus on High-Revenue Age Groups
Customers aged 55–64 show the highest spending—target them with age-appropriate messaging, premium offerings, or loyalty bonuses.

### 5. Geo-Target Marketing in Top Regions
Prioritize Europe and North America in paid marketing campaigns, product localization, and shipping optimizations.

Explore expansion opportunities in underperforming regions using similar segmentation strategies.

### 6. Leverage Top Customers
Recognize top customers with VIP perks or public shoutouts to reinforce loyalty.

Analyze their purchase paths to replicate success across similar profiles.
